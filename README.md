# lifeR
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in R with a unit test suite

This was inspired by Coderetreat 2015, which was all about test-driven development.

I realised I didn't know how to do it in my current main language, R! That has been remedied,
and this is on GitHub for all the people who said "R? What's that?" as a minimal example of the language.

Shout out to Rookie Oven, as well as @dthjones and @jamesmaciver who showed me some of the magic of TDD
