# lifeR
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life in R with a unit test suite

This was inspired by Coderetreat 2015, which was all about test-driven development.

I realised I didn't know how to do it in my current main language, R! That has been remedied,
and this is on GitHub for all the people who said "R? What's that?" as a minimal example of the language.

Shout out to Rookie Oven, as well as [@dthjones](https://github.com/dthjones) and [@jamesmaciver](https://github.com/jamesmaciver) who showed me some of the magic of TDD

## Install

If you have `R`, run it, then you also need to `install.packages("RUnit")`, then `source("lifeR.R")` to load the program and run the tests, and finally `runSim()` to see those automata flood across your screen!
